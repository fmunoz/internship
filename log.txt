Tues June 16 2020: Beginning SpriteKit tutorial

Today I completed the first 3 parts of a tutorial on how to use SpriteKit. I learned how to add sprites, how to put them on to Game Scenes, and how to manipulate where and how they move, and the direction they are pointing in. It took some time to get used to Swift on Xcode after using Java on Eclipse for the entire duration of the last school year.

Mon June 15 2020: Git Hub tutorial

Today I completed the Git Hub tutorial you assigned to me. It had me create github account, and walked me through how to use it to create new repositories and branches, as well as how to merge those branches to the main "master branch". This enables you to work to have multiple people working on the same file at the same time by utilizing the creation of new branches, which eventually can be merged using pull requests. Merge requests can be accepted and/or commented on depending on their validity.
